# Public Assets

Place any static files (logos, favicons, Open Graph images, downloads, etc.) in this folder so they are served directly from the root of your deployed site.

## Structure
- `public/images/branding` – Logos, favicons, lockups, and other brand assets.
- `public/images/marketing` – Hero art, illustration exports, and social images.
- `public/downloads` – Static documents you want to link directly (PDFs, press kits, etc.).

Feel free to add additional subdirectories to keep assets organized. Any file you add here becomes available via `/filename.ext` (for example, `public/images/branding/logo.svg` is served at `/images/branding/logo.svg`).
